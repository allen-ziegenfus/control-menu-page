# Expanded page control menu

This is a simple Liferay module for adding some extra useful icons when working with pages in Liferay. OOTB it is difficult to administer some aspects of pages.

Extending `BaseJSPProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` it adds the following:

- A "Manage Page" button to jump to the page in the Site Builder -> Pages administration
- A permissions button that shows at a glance if a page has guest permissions. Clicking on the button allows for
administration of the permissions.
